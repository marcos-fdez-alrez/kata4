## Exercise 4 - Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Exercise 6 - Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385 
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
